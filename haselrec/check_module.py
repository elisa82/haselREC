    """

    This module is called when mode :code:`--check-NGArec` is specified.

    It identifies NGA-West2 records not already stored on the computer
    from the list of selected IDs.

    It requires to have run mode :code:`--run-selection` in advance since it reads
    in input the summary file created by mode :code:`--run-selection`

    It generates the file::

        missing_NGArec.txt

    which contains the list of missing NGA-West2 records.
    Example::

        Missing NGA-West2 IDrecords
